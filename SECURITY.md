## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

At MPG, we take security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any security vulnerabilities you may find.

If you believe you've discovered a security vulnerability in our project, please follow these guidelines to report it:

1. **Do Not Publicly Disclose**: Please do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we've had a chance to address it.

2. **Provide Details**: Send an email to [glorifiedesigns@gmail.com] with details about the vulnerability. Include a clear description of the issue, the steps to reproduce it, and any relevant information that can help us understand and address the vulnerability.

3. **Encryption**: If possible, encrypt your email using our public PGP key to ensure the security of the information you're sharing. You can find our PGP key [here](link-to-pgp-key).

4. **Response Time**: We will acknowledge your report within 3 business days and provide an estimated timeline for when you can expect a resolution.

5. **Cooperation**: We appreciate your cooperation in keeping the vulnerability confidential until we can release a fix.

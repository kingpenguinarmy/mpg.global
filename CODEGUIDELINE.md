## General Guidelines

- Write clean and readable code. Use proper indentation, consistent naming conventions, and meaningful variable names.

- Prioritize code clarity over cleverness. Code should be easy to understand and maintain by all team members.

- Comment your code to explain complex logic, algorithms, and non-obvious behavior. Use clear and concise comments.

## HTML

- Use semantic HTML elements wherever possible to enhance accessibility and SEO.

- Ensure your HTML is well-formatted and organized. Use proper indentation for nested elements.

- Include alt attributes for images to improve accessibility.

## CSS

- Use a consistent naming convention for CSS classes (e.g., BEM, SMACSS).

- Avoid using overly complex selectors that may lead to specificity issues.

- Group related CSS rules together and use comments to indicate sections.

- Opt for CSS preprocessors (e.g., Sass, Less) to enhance maintainability and reusability.

## JavaScript

- Follow ES6+ standards for writing JavaScript.

- Use meaningful variable and function names that accurately describe their purpose.

- Avoid global variables whenever possible. Encapsulate your code within modules or functions.

- Use arrow functions for concise one-line functions.

- Handle errors gracefully using try-catch blocks.

## Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and files.

- Follow a consistent naming convention throughout the project.

- Use camelCase for variables and functions (e.g., `myVariable`, `calculateTotal`).

- Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., `MyClass`, `ComponentName`).

## Version Control

- Use a feature branch workflow for development. Create a new branch for each new feature or bug fix.

- Write clear and concise commit messages that explain the purpose of the changes.

- Keep commits focused and atomic, addressing a single task or issue.

- Regularly pull from the main branch to keep your feature branch up-to-date.

By following these guidelines, we ensure that our codebase remains consistent, maintainable, and accessible to all team members. Your contributions play a vital role in achieving these goals.
